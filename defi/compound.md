The Compound Protocol is an Ethereum smart contract for supplying or borrowing assets. Through the cToken contracts, accounts on the blockchain _supply_ capital \(Ether or ERC-20 tokens\) to receive cTokens or _borrow_ assets from the protocol \(holding other assets as collateral\). The Compound cToken contracts track these balances and algorithmically set interest rates for borrowers.
